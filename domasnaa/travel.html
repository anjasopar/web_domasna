        <h1>Travel</h1>
        <p>
            As I mentioned earlier, I absolutely love to travel – it’s one of the things that fills me with inspiration and excitement. Exploring new places, cultures, and atmospheres helps me grow, reflect, and collect memories that stay with me forever. In this section, I’ll share a few of my favorite destinations that I’ve had the chance to visit so far: the romantic charm of Paris, the timeless beauty of Rome, the vibrant energy of Barcelona, and the coastal magic of Croatia.

    <h1>Paris</h1>

                Paris completely stole my heart. It’s a city full of elegance, history, and timeless charm. I loved wandering through the narrow streets of Montmartre, admiring the Eiffel Tower sparkling at night, and sipping coffee at cute little cafés. Everything felt like a scene from a movie – stylish, romantic, and inspiring.
                What made it even more special for me was the atmosphere – that soft, dreamy feeling that Paris gives you without even trying. Every corner feels meaningful, whether it’s a quiet bookstore, a walk along the Seine, or a simple croissant in the morning light. Paris made me slow down, breathe deeply, and fall in love with the beauty of small details.

    <h1>Barcelona</h1>
    <div id="Barcelona">

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                Barcelona was full of color, rhythm, and creativity. The energy there is contagious – you can feel it in the people, the music, and the art that fills the city. Gaudí’s architecture was unlike anything I’ve ever seen – playful and surreal, like something from a different world. I spent hours wandering through Park Güell, admiring the views from the hills, and enjoying tapas by the beach. It’s a city that knows how to enjoy life, and that spirit stayed with me long after I left.

    <h1>Rome</h1>
    <div id="Rome">
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                Rome is one of those cities where history isn’t behind glass – it’s around you, alive, part of everyday life. I was amazed by how the ancient and modern blend together so effortlessly. Standing in front of the Colosseum, I could almost imagine the past unfolding. I explored the narrow cobblestone streets, tasted the most delicious pasta, and threw a coin into the Trevi Fountain with a wish in my heart.
