        <p>
                  Hello! My name is Anja Shopar, and I'm 19 years old. I live in Skopje, Macedonia – my hometown where I grew up and was born. I'm currently studying at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI), where I'm pursuing my passion for technology and where I'm constantly seeking new ways to learn and grow as a human being and as a professional.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            I began my education in elementary school "Goce Delchev"  and later graduated from the high school “Orce Nikolov”. These years were key in shaping my character – teaching me the importance of dedication, curiosity, and believing in myself. Today, I’m proud to be continuing my academic journey at FINKI, a place that constantly challenges me and inspires me to improve.

        <h2>Personal Interest</h2>
        <p>
            Outside of my studies, I’m passionate about many things that bring me joy and balance. Fashion is one of my  interests; I see it as a form of self-expression and a way to build confidence. I also enjoy traveling, watching TV series, and working out regularly. Exercise is not just a hobby for me; it’s a way to stay mentally and physically strong.

        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
            I’d describe myself as empathetic, ambitious, and friendly. I genuinely enjoy connecting with people and exploring new perspectives. I can sometimes be indecisive – especially when I want to make thoughtful, well-balanced choices – but I’m also deeply loyal and committed once I set my mind on something. I stay true to my values and believe in showing up fully for the people and goals that matter to me. Personal growth, honesty, and curiosity are principles I try to live by every day.

        <h2>My Vision</h2>
        <p>
            My Vision
            Right now, I’m in a phase of self-discovery and growth. I’m learning more about what I love, what I’m capable of, and the kind of future I want to create for myself. I believe in staying kind, curious, and true to myself – and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me.
