      Fashion and fitness might seem different, but for me, they’re both about confidence and feeling good in my own skin. Whether I’m trying a new workout or putting together an outfit, I love the process of growth, discovery, and expressing my personality.

        I’ve always loved staying active and leading a healthy lifestyle. Earlier in life, I trained volleyball, which taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Nowadays, I focus on Pilates and regularly go to the gym to keep my body strong. I also enjoy long walks — they help me clear my mind and recharge my energy. Being active is not just a routine for me, it’s a way to stay balanced both physically and mentally.

          Apart from sports and fitness, I have a big passion for fashion. I see fashion as a form of self-expression and creativity that allows me to show who I am without words. Shopping is something I truly enjoy — it’s not just about buying clothes, but about discovering new styles, mixing pieces, and finding inspiration. For me, a good shopping trip is relaxing and fun; it’s a way to refresh my mind, explore trends, and treat myself a little.
